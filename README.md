# particle-portrait
Particle portrait that responds to mouse movement by disassembling and reassembling.

Project that takes a .png version of my line art portrait and draws it on Canvas API. Mouse movement through "pixels" cause pixels to move away and return to their original position. 

Thanks to Kevin Franks (@thefrankslab) for the JavaScript guidance. Thanks to onlinepngtools for the base64 converter.
